## Goals
* Change the log level without restart - no downtime
* Change the log level per request. Setting the log level to debug on an app with high load could result in log flood and even loss of log messages.
* All application instances use the same log level.
* Set the log level from server-side as it is often hard to change client requests. This is also less susceptible to DoS attacks.
* Temporary log level change
  - Time based
  - Request count based
* Integrate with different logging libraries. Logging lib agnostic.

## Requirements
* Node.js 6 (or later)
* Cloud Foundry
* Redis

## Design
We need some persistence of the log level, so new instances can load it.
To achieve this, we use Redis as it provides both storage and change notification via [keyspace notifications](https://redis.io/topics/notifications).

This package provides a CLI interface to change the log configuration.
There are several options to invoke it:
* [CF task](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/using-tasks.html)
* [ssh] to a running application

Deployment options:
* As part of an existing Node.js app
  - No additional app
* As a separate app
  - Can be used with applications that do not run on Node.js
  - Does not need to run. Executing CF task will start a temporary instance automatically
  - One more app to manage

In any case the application should be bound to a Redis instance.

## Usage

### In the application

Install the package.
```sh
npm install --save niveau
```
With npm 5 you don't need the `--save` option.

Configure _niveau_ and add it as a middleware:
```js
const express = require('express');
const niveau = require('niveau');

let nv = niveau(/* redis options */);
nv.on('error', err => {
  console.error(err);
});
nv.on('config', config => {
  // log configuration changed
});
nv.on('request', (req, config) => {
  // request matches logging criteria
  // set log level for this request to config.level
});

let app = express();
app.use(nv);
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // req.logLevel - the log level to be used for this request (if present)
  // nv.logConfig - the current log configuration
});
```

See example applications in [examples](examples) folder.
#### niveau([options])
* `options` Redis connection [options](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis#rediscreateclient) + additional properties:
  * `redisKey` name of the Redis key that stores the configuration, default is `log-config`

Creates _niveau_ middleware. It matches incoming requests against the criteria in the log configuration.
For matching requests it sets `logLevel` property on the request object to the log level from the configuration.

If `options` is not provided, use bound Redis service.
If no Redis service is bound, use local Redis on default port.

The middleware also listens for log configuration changes and emits some events.

#### Event 'error'
Event arguments:
* `error` an `Error` object

Emitted in case of error, e.g. Redis connection failed.

#### Event 'config'
Event arguments:
* `config` [log configuration](#log-configuration) object, `null` if no configuration is set

Emitted when log configuration is changed or deleted.

#### Event 'request'
Event arguments:
* `request` [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)
* `config` [log configuration](#log-configuration) object

Emitted when an HTTP request matches the criteria in the log configuration.

#### nv.logConfig
Contains the current [log configuration](#log-configuration).
It is `null` if no log configuration is set.

#### Log configuration
Log configuration object:
* `request` (optional) request matching criteria,
if missing or empty, the log level should be used for all requests
  * `url` (optional) `RegExp` to match against the request URL
  * `ip` (optional) `RegExp` to match against the client IP address
  * `headers` (optional) an object to match against request headers, each values is a `RegExp`
* `level` log level as a string to use for matching requests

### Changing the log level
This package provides a command line tool to change the log level.
The provided log level will be used only for HTTP requests that match _all_ the given criteria.
Each command invocation overwrites any previous settings.

```sh
set-log-level [options...] [<level>]
```
#### Options
* `-l, --url <regex>` - matches request URL (without protocol, host, port)
* `-h, --header <name>:<regex>` - matches given request header value
* `-i, --ip <regex>` - matches sender IP address
* `-x, --expire <value>` - expiration time with `s/m/h` suffix
* `-r, --reset` - reset log level to default (do not provide level)
* `--help` - print usage
* `<level>` - log level to use for matching requests, supported values depend on your log library

#### Invoke via CF task
This will start a temporary instance of the application, run the task inside and stop that instance.
```sh
cf run-task APP-NAME "set-log-level [options] [<level>]" [-m MEMORY] [--name TASK_NAME]
```
Check the output in the logs
```sh
cf logs --recent APP-NAME
```

#### Invoke via SSH to the application
Log into the container of a running application and execute the command:
```sh
cf ssh APP-NAME
export PATH=$PATH:~/deps/0/bin:~/app/node_modules/.bin
set-log-level [options...] <level>
```
This is useful if you need to run it multiple times and see the output immediately.

#### Examples
Set log level to debug for requests on URLs starting with `/api/v2`. Reset log level after 15 min.
```sh
set-log-level -l '^/api/v2/' --expire 15m debug
```

## Contributing
Install all dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
Run static code checks with _eslint_ and unit tests:
```sh
npm test
```
Integration tests require Redis to run on localhost on default port 6379.
Install [docker], unless you have it already.
Start Redis:
```sh
npm run redis
```
Run the integration tests against Redis:
```sh
npm run itest
```
Generate test coverage report:
```sh
npm run coverage
```

After editing README.md update its table of contents:
```sh
npm run toc
```

## Future
Ideas for [new features](https://github.com/niveau/niveau/labels/enhancement) are tracked in GitHub issues. You are encouraged to comment, add new ideas and contribute in any way.
